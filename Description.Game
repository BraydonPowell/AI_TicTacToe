My AI-powered Tic-Tac-Toe game implements the Minimax algorithm to create an intelligent opponent that makes optimal moves. 
The Minimax algorithm is a recursive decision-making strategy used in two-player games to minimize the opponent’s best possible
outcome while maximizing the AI’s chances of winning. The AI evaluates all possible future moves, assigns scores based on win, 
loss, or draw scenarios, and selects the move that ensures the best outcome. This makes the AI unbeatable unless the human player also plays optimally.
The game is structured with an interface-based Player system, where both the HumanPlayer and AIPlayer classes implement a common Player interface.
The Board class manages the 3x3 grid, checking for valid moves, win conditions, and game state updates. 
The Game class orchestrates turns between the human and AI, ensuring smooth gameplay. 
Through this project, I deepened my understanding of game theory, recursion, and AI decision-making, making the Minimax algorithm a crucial part of the AI’s strategic thinking.
